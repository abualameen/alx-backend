# Pagination in Python

This project demonstrates different methods of paginating datasets in Python, focusing on three specific techniques:

1. **Paginating with Simple Page and Page Size Parameters**
2. **Paginating with Hypermedia Metadata**
3. **Paginating in a Deletion-Resilient Manner**

## 1. Paginating with Simple Page and Page Size Parameters

This method involves paginating a dataset using basic page and page size parameters. It's straightforward and commonly used in various applications.

To use this method, you provide two parameters:
- `page`: The page number you want to retrieve (starting from 1).
- `page_size`: The number of items to include per page.

The function `index_range(page, page_size)` returns a tuple containing the start and end indices of the dataset corresponding to the specified page and page size.

Example usage:
```python
from pagination import index_range

# Retrieve the index range for page 1 with a page size of 7
start, end = index_range(1, 7)
print(f"Index range for page 1: ({start}, {end})")
```

## 2. Paginating with Hypermedia Metadata

This method involves paginating a dataset using hypermedia metadata, which provides additional information about the dataset structure and navigation links.

In this approach, instead of just retrieving a specific page of data, the response includes hypermedia links to navigate to the next or previous pages, as well as metadata about the current page and total number of pages.

Example usage:
```python
# TODO: Implement paginating with hypermedia metadata
```

## 3. Paginating in a Deletion-Resilient Manner

This method ensures resilience to data deletions during pagination. It prevents issues where items are deleted from the dataset while paginating, causing inconsistencies or errors.

To achieve deletion-resilient pagination, the pagination mechanism must be able to handle changes in the dataset's size and structure, such as items being deleted or added between paginated requests.

Example usage:
```python
# TODO: Implement deletion-resilient pagination
```

## Setup

To run the examples provided in this project, ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can clone this repository and execute the Python scripts to see the pagination methods in action.

## Additional Notes

- Each pagination method has its advantages and use cases. Consider the requirements and constraints of your application when choosing the appropriate pagination technique.
- Documentation and comments within the code provide further details about each pagination method and its implementation.
